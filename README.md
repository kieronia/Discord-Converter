# Discord-Converter

This project is a demo as it uses usertokens, which is against tos.

Details on how it works:

upon every message being sent, it'll delete the message from your account(perms required)

It will read the data of each message, name , discrim(tag),message content and your avatar.

Then it'll send that through a webhook, giving the illusion that your a discord bot!

Users can't have the tag #0000 and webhooks always have the tag #0000, so this checks to see if your discrim IS NOT 0000 and proceeds to do it's task.


Pretty useless but fun to experiment with, lots of my friends got extremely confused xd
